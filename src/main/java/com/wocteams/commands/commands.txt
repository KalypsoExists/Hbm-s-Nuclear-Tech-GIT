/sector
/sector jail <member> (cell)
/sector pardon <member>
/sector banish <player>

But what if I want to add a member of another sector to a plot in my sector?
Should the members list in a plot be based on a pre check for who is being added?
So we limit it to someone part of the team

/plot set jail
/plot member add
